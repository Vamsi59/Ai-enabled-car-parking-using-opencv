# Ai-enabled-car-parking-using-opencv
OpenCV is an extensive open source library (available in python, Java, and C++) that's used for image analysis and is pretty neat.

The lofty goal for my OpenCV experiment was to take any static image or video of a parking lot and be able to automatically detect whenever a parking space was available or occupied.
What I was able accomplish was to detect how many spots were available in a parking lot, with just a bit of upfront work by the user.

I'll start with an overview, then talk about my process, and end with some ideas for future work.
